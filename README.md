# Network Tree Coding Challenge 

Hi there! I have split the code into two parts: backend and frontend.

## Backend 
I implemented an Express server after looking through documentation.
You can navigate to the backend directory by doing `cd backend`.

### Running the server and setup

1. Begin by installing dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Run the dev server: `node app.js`.
3. Navigate to the [localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040).


## Frontend 
I implemented the carousel component with React Native and Expo. I looked at the documentation for native specific components and needs: along of course with stackoverflow.
You can navigate to the backend directory by doing `cd frontend`.
### Running the app and setup

1. Begin by installing dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Make sure to have Xcode and command line tools installed.
3. Run the app locally: `npx expo start`.


Thank you so much for the opportunity! Lots of fun using a tech stack I don't normally use :)
